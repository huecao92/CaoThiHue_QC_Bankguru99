# CaoThiHue_QC_Bankguru99
Selenium
- This is Java project, i used Selenium 2.0 (WebDriver) and TestNG library to build.
The project verified 3 functions of Demo Banking system:
1. Verify new customer can be created.
2. Verify to create new account based on the customer just created above.
3. Verify deposit function work fine with the account just created.

- This tests is fine if the Account(userName = "mngr184796"; passWord = "ApYbusu") is not out of date (Out of date time : 20 d√°y from creating accouting from Bankguru).
In case the Bankguru account is expired, You should request Bankguru renew account  to replace the old account on my code( (userName = "mngr184796"; passWord = "ApYbusu")
